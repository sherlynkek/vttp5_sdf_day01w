You are to implement the following commands
- *list* - list the contents of the cart. If the cart is empty, print an appropriate message. The contents of the cart should be numbered when you are listing them
- *add* - add one or more items to the cart. Multiple items are separated by a comma(,).
You should not add an item that is already in the cart. Print an appropriate message.
Item names are case sensitice (or you can try implementing case insensitive)
- *delete* - delete an item from the cart based on the item's index (from *list* command). If an incorrect index is provided, display an error message.
